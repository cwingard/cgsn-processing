# CG and EA Mooring Baseline Configuration Templates

The Coastal and Global (CG) and Endurance Array (EA) instrument teams use a set of templates to configure moorings
for use in the OMS++ system and elsewhere. The templates in this directory are used to
generate the mooring configuration files and represent the baseline configuration for each mooring.
